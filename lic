Last update: 29 September 2014

Introduction

These release notes describe issues specific to the Git for Windows release.

General release notes covering the history of the core git commands are included in the subdirectory doc/git/html of the installation directory. Look for files starting with RelNotes.

See http://git-scm.com/ for further details about Git including ports to other operating systems. Git for Windows is hosted at http://msysgit.github.com/.

Known issues
•	Some commands are not yet supported on Windows and excluded from the installation; namely: git archimport, git cvsexportcommit, git cvsimport, git cvsserver, git instaweb, git shell.
•	As Git for Windows is built without Python support, all Git commands requiring Python are not yet supported; namely: git p4, git remote-hg, git remote-testgit.
•	The Logitec QuickCam software can cause spurious crashes. See "Why does make often crash creating a sh.exe.stackdump file when I try to compile my source code?" on the MinGW Wiki
